                    SOLO LEVELING NOVEL, CHAPTER 1
                    Rank E Hunter, Seong Jin-Woo.
                    No matter where he went, this title always followed him around.
                    Jin-Woo’s overall strength was almost the same as a regular human being. With the exception of being a bit stronger and his wounds healing slightly faster, Jin-Woo was about the same as regular people in every other aspect.
                    It was par for the course then, that he’d always end up getting injured. He nearly died several times, too.
                    Of course, it wasn’t as if Seong Jin-Woo liked being a Hunter.
                    The work was dangerous, others made fun of him, and to confound the matters even further, the pay was pretty pathetic, as well.
                    If it weren’t for the medical aid paid out by the Hunter Association to the Hunters in their “payroll”, he’d have turned in his hunter licence and quit by now, and live his life like a regular person.
                    Unfortunately, someone like Seong Jin-Woo, in his mid-twenties and lacking in any tangible job skills, there was no other way but to remain as a Hunter if he wanted to pay for his mother’s hospital fee of millions of won every month.
                    Should one say that he had no choice in the matter?
                    That was why, even though he didn’t want to, he simply had to participate in the raid supervised by the Association.
                    ***
                    Hunters operating within the same area tended to know each other pretty well. In the event of a Gate opening up, all the Hunters in that district would be asked to come, that’s why.
                    The Hunters who had arrived early sipped on the cups of coffee handed out by the Association’s employee and shared cordial greetings with each other.
                    “Oh, hey. Mister Kim, Over here. Here.”
                    “Oh? Mister Park, what are you doing here? I thought you were giving up on being a Hunter?”
                    “Well, that… My wife is pregnant with our second child.”
                    “Hahahaha, is that so. Yeah, for a Hunter to earn big in one go, participating in a raid is the best, isn’t it.”
                    Mister Kim jovially burst out in laughter. Mister Park followed suit with a sheepish chuckle, before asking Kim.
                    “By the way, why do I feel like that the Association is calling on us less and less nowadays? Did the number of Gates decrease or something?”
                    “Eii, of course not. That’s only because the Guilds are getting all worked up over clearing the Gates; it’s got nothing to do with the Association. I hear that various Guilds are jumping in with both feet since there is big profit involved in this whole thing.”
                    “Well, in that case, since this raid is being supervised by the Association, it should be safe, no?”
                    Mister Park took a glance around as if he was getting nervous.
                    If a Guild was not involved today, that meant there wasn’t enough profit to be had, and if there wasn’t enough profit to be had, then that could only mean that this particular Gate’s difficulty would be low.
                    Of course, nothing in this world was 100% absolute.
                    It wasn’t just Mister Park; other Hunters were nervously glancing around as well.
                    “Hmm. I wonder….”
                    Mister Kim finished the rest of his coffee while avoiding answering his friend, before spotting a certain someone and raised his hand in happiness.
                    “Uh! He’s here. Hey, Mister Seong!! Mister Seong!”
                    Other Hunters also displayed joy at discovering that young man.
                    “Ah, hello.”
                    It was none other than Seong Jin-Woo.
                    Jin-Woo performed a simple nod of the head at the joyous Mister Kim and walked by.
                    After making sure Jin-Woo was well out of earshot, Mister Kim began sniggering while confidently speaking up.
                    “So, Jin-Woo showed up. Then it’s going to okay today, too.”
                    Mister Park’s eyes widened up and he hurriedly asked Kim.
                    “What was that? Is that Hunter Seong Jin-Woo really strong?”
                    “Ahh. Right, of course, you wouldn’t know who he is. He’s a Hunter who started working shortly after you left, you see. However, every Hunter here knows who that kid is by now.”
                    “He’s really that strong? Wait, why is he working for the Association, then? Why not for a Guild or as a freelancer?”
                    Kim sniggered some more before narrowing his eyes.
                    “You know what that guy’s nickname is?”
                    “How should I know that? C’mon, man. Just tell me already.”
                    “Humanity’s weakest weapon.”
                    “….Weakest? Not something like, the ultimate weapon?”
                    “Dude, that’s the nickname for the rank S Hunter Choi Jong-In. That kid is the ‘weakest weapon’. I’m pretty sure he’s the weakest Hunter in the Republic of Korea.”
                    “Really?”
                    Park began frowning deeply.
                    Why would other Hunters greet this Seong Jin-Woo if he was really that weak? After all, didn’t they need someone to trust their backs if things went south?
                    Park couldn’t really understand the reactions of other Hunters.
                    When Park’s head tilted this way and that, Kim chuckled and poked the side of Park with his elbow.
                    “Eii! The raids Seong Jin-Woo participates in will only have low difficulty because he’s so weak. The Association would never entrust him with a tough job, don’t you get that? They don’t want to see him get killed, right?”
                    Only then did Park’s expression brightened up.
                    “R-right. Yeah.”
                    His wife was deeply worried about him since this would be his first raid in quite a while. Honestly, even he himself was worried, too. However, now that he listened to Kim’s words, he felt like a weight was lifted off his mind.
                    Kim continued on.
                    “That guy, there was a rumour not too long ago that said, he got injured participating in a raid of a rank E Gate and spent a week in the hospital.”
                    “A Hunter got injured by a rank E Gate?”
                    “That’s right. No one expected to see a Hunter getting injured during a rank E Gate raid, so they didn’t even bring along a Healer, apparently!”
                    “That’s why he spent a week in a hospital?! Pu-hahaha!”
                    When Park began guffawing too loudly, Kim hurriedly hushed him.
                    “Stop it, man. Mister Seong might hear you.”
                    “Aigoo. I didn’t think of that.”
                    Park cautiously checked Jin-Woo’s reactions as he continued to giggle.
                    Thankfully, the distance was far enough and the youth didn’t seem to have heard them.
                    Of course, they were mistaken.
                    ‘I can hear everything, you geezers.’
                    A bitter smile formed on Jin-Woo as he tried hard to ignore them. At times like today, he couldn’t help but blame his unusually-acute sense of hearing.
                    It seemed that he arrived too early and the raid was yet to commence.
                    ‘Did I arrive too early?’
                    Jin-Woo looked around to while away the waiting time, spotted the Association employee handing out warm coffee, and walked closer.
                    “Can I get a cup of coffee as well?”
                    “Oh. Seong Jin-Woo Hunter-nim… I’m really sorry, but we ran out of coffee just now.”
                    “……”
                    The cold Winter breeze brushed past the tip of his nose.
                    Jin-Woo quietly wiped his nose with his index finger.
                    What a sad day it was, for the coffee to run out as soon as it was his turn to get one.
                    ***
                    “Why do you persist on being a Hunter, Mister Seong Jin-Woo?”
                    “I’m sorry.”
                    Jin-Woo lowered his head and apologised.
                    The young, beautiful girl using healing magic in front of Jin-Woo, Yi Ju-Hui showed how unhappy she was with a pouting expression.
                    “I’m not trying to get you to apologise, you know? I’m only worried about you. If you continue fighting this way, sooner or later you’ll be faced with a truly dangerous situation.”
                    Jin-Woo glanced past Yi Ju-Hui’s shoulders and took a look at other Hunters fighting over yonder.
                    When one entered through the Gate, one would arrive at a place called ‘dungeon’. The rank of this particular dungeon should be around D.
                    A dozen-plus Hunters were taking care of the monsters inside this dungeon without so much as breaking a sweat.
                    Unfortunately, for a rank E, such a feat was nearly impossible.
                    Normally, the job of healing the injured Hunters from the back fell on the Healers. Since he always got injured during raids, Jin-Woo was rather well-known among the Healers.
                    Yi Ju-Hui cautiously asked him.
                    “Perchance, is there a reason why you can’t give up being a Hunter?”
                    Jin-Woo resolutely shook his head.
                    He didn’t want to reveal anything personal to other people.
                    “I’m only doing this as a hobby. If I don’t do this, I’ll probably die of boredom, actually.”
                    Yi Ju-Hui pouted even more.
                    “If you continue on with this hobby of yours, soon you’d be raiding a dungeon in the netherworld, you know?”
                    Jin-Woo was taken off-guard from her remark and ended up chuckling out loudly.
                    Thanks to that, Yi Ju-Hui’s nagging intensified.
                    “Ah, ahh!! Don’t laugh! Don’t! Your injuries might get worse!!”
                    Jin-Woo giggled before asking her.
                    “Where did you even learn to say stuff like that?”
                    “What do you mean, where? It’s from Mister Kim waaay over there.”
                    “Aigoo, that ahjussi really went and did it, didn’t he….”
                    As they chatted and laughed, his treatment was almost over.
                    It was already too late by then, though. It seemed that the raid was pretty much over now.
                    Jin-Woo’s expression hardened.
                    ‘I only killed a single monster today.’
                    A rank E creature, no less. Seong Jin-Woo began fidgeting with the rank E magic crystal in his hand.
                    The lowest grade magic crystal from a rank E monster fetched less than hundred thousand won. For something he bet his life to earn, it was a pathetically small amount. (TL: Just over $88.)
                    ‘A magic crystal from a rank C monster can sell for over ten million won, though….’ (TL: $8830+)
                    Too bad, a rank E Hunter such as himself couldn’t even attempt to kill a monster with a rank as high as C.
                    Out of the blue, someone shouted out.
                    “Uh? Hey, there’s another entrance over here.”
                    The nearby Hunters rushed over there.
                    “Huh, it’s true.”
                    “There really is another path?”
                    Just as that Hunter said, there was an entrance hidden within the dungeon itself.
                    “A dual dungeon, is it… So, such a thing actually exists for real….”
                    Mister Song, possessing over ten years’ experience as a Hunter, looked into the hidden entrance and displayed how surprised he was.
                    The interior of the hidden, cave-like passage was dark and nothing could be seen. Mister Song activated his speciality, flame magic, and tossed it further forward into the passage.
                    The flame flew forward and illuminated the interior. The passageway seemed to go on forever. Soon enough, the flame lost its forward momentum, fell to the ground and smouldered for a bit before flickering out of existence.
                    The passage was shrouded in darkness once more.
                    “Hmm….. Everyone, gather around. Let’s have a meeting.”
                    The unspoken leader of this raid, Mister Song, called for other Hunters to gather around. Jin-Woo’s treatment was over by then, so he and Yi Ju-Hui also joined in.
                    Song spoke up while sweeping his gaze over the gathered Hunters.
                    “As you know very well, a Gate will not close unless the dungeon’s boss is killed. Since the Gate itself is still intact even though we took care of all the monsters here, that can only mean that the boss is beyond that passageway.”
                    Song pointed towards the hidden entrance.
                    Hunters exchanged meaningful glances and nodded their heads. No one could disagree with that notion.
                    Song continued on.
                    “Now normally, we’re supposed to relay this information back to the Association and wait for their decision first, but… But, if we do that, we might end up handing over the task of killing the boss to other Hunters, and our takings for today’s raid would decrease by a lot.”
                    The expressions of the Hunters crumpled.
                    Park’s face hardened more than anyone else since he needed a lot of cash for his wife’s pregnancy.
                    ‘Postnatal care eats up so much cash nowadays, you know…’
                    At this rate, there’d be no meaning behind him risking his life to participate in this raid.
                    “That’s why I’d prefer if we took care of the boss before leaving this dungeon… So, what do you all think?”
                    Hunters fell into a deep contemplation.
                    “….”
                    The truth was, no one here could figure out the current situation and so, their safety could not be guaranteed. However, the difficulty of this particular dungeon proved to be very low.
                    So, the hidden dungeon within it couldn’t have been that difficult, either.
                    “Hmm, hmm.”
                    Song coughed to draw everyone’s attention to himself.
                    “Since we have seventeen people here, let’s put this to a vote, shall we? Once the decision has been made, no one complains. So? How about it?”
                    Others nodded their heads after hearing Song’s suggestion. No one was disagreeing with him.
                    “I vote for going ahead.”
                    Song raised his hand.
                    And then, other Hunters began raising their hands one by one.
                    “Me too.”
                    “Count me in as well.”
                    Park was the first to raise his hand, followed shortly after by Kim and a few other Hunters.
                    Of course, those disagreeing were plentiful, too.
                    “Let’s go back.”
                    “I feel that it’d be better to wait for the Association’s decision.”
                    The two opposing camps were neck and neck and eventually, the final votes came down to Jin-Woo and Yi Ju-Hui.
                    “I’m sorry….”
                    Yi Ju-Hui bowed to Song and added her vote to ‘retreat’ camp.
                    And so, the vote count for ‘go ahead’ and ‘retreat’ was at 8:8.
                    A deadlock.
                    Song asked the hesitant Seong Jin-Woo next.
                    “And you, Mister Seong?”

                    <p> Solo leveling contained one of the best balance of story and action. It follows the story Seong Jin-Woo and his rise to from being the weakest to strongest hunter ever creater. 
                        In a world where monsters appear out of portals from a different dimension, Jin-Woo's character struggles to survive for the sake of his family. The author's depiction of the 
                        characters desparation to act whilst being the weakest reported hunter captivated me to continue "flipping the pages" to see where his journey would lead. As I continue 
                        to progress through the chapters you will see the magnitude of the impending doom and how the author ties it all together in the final chapter. If youre a fan of action and story of
                        biblical proportions then I suggest you endulge yourself in this fantasy world.

                    How a realist Hero King bebuilt a Kingdom chapter 1
                    [Elfrieden Kingdom Capital Parnam]
                    It was the city where [Castle Parnam], where the Elfrieden Royalty dwells, is located. The castle town surrounding Castle Parnam flourished, the walls surrounding the city brings up the image of a medieval European city-state. The roofs on the buildings were a uniform orange, their appearance fitting well with the city’s classic ambience.
                    There were main streets running east, west, south, and north with Castle Parnam at the center, each connecting to their respective gates, where carts and large beast mounts stream endlessly. Other than those there were countless small stone-paved streets running radial lines from the castle, and there were more streets connectingthose streets together, looking like a spiderweb (or maybe a snowflake) when seen from the sky. On either side of those streets stood shopping districts and artisans’ districts, perpetually bustling with people.
                    Today was a national holiday, furthermore a holiday celebrating the enthronement of a new king, so the shopping districts are even more busy than usual. Because of the sudden change in rulership the castle town was in a tense state for a short time, but once it was clear that the enthroned king was the summoned hero, that the old king handed over the throne out of his own will, and that the hero was to wed the king’s daughter Princess Liecia so as the father-in-law the previous king won’t be treated badly, the chaos resolved itself. It was because the former king ‘was loved’ during his rule to begin with.
                    [Well, if the king is all right then all’s well I suppose]
                    [Now he can probably relax. Good for him, huh]
                    It was generally interpreted favourably like so…. it seems the King’s carefree attitude was a national trait. Soma, who had the throne pushed onto him against his will, expected at least one opposition movement to rise against the sudden change, but he took it without a fight¹. In any case, the scenery in Parnam today was that of humans and therianthrope and dwarves coming and going in peace.
                    ¹ «TN: Literally he took it like taking an underarm push»
                    That afternoon, a white horse ran on the stone pavements as if cutting through the peaceful atmosphere.
                    The one riding it was a beautiful girl in red and white military dress uniform right out of [Rose of Versailles], her platinum blonde hair tied in a ponytail, fluttering in the wind. Her age is about 16-17. Her transparent-seeming white skin and tightly-fitting military uniform accentuated her well-balanced figure.
                    Just the figure of the girl riding on the white horse would unmistakably make for a pretty picture. Seeing her, people along the way spontaneously let out sighs of admiration and raised cheers when they realized that she was the country’s ‘princess’.
                    “Princess! Congratulations on your engagement!”
                    “I wish you happiness!”
                    Without knowing her actual feelings, they gave her such warm cheers.
                    The sound of their cheers did not reach her ears in her current state, though.
                    “Father, Mother, please be safe…. I’m coming for you.”
                    She, Liecia Elfrieden, muttered with a face of grief.
                    “Father! What is the meaning of this!”
                    The Royal Private Chambers. A large room so large a king size bed couldn’t dominate it, each and every one of its furnishings were elegantly crafted. Normally, this room should have been the royal couple’s bedroom and private room, and after the handing over of the throne it should’ve been given to Soma, but Soma who disliked the trouble involved in moving gave permission to the previous royal couple to continue using it so these two were still here. Incidentally, Soma still doesn’t have his own room. The reason he gave was because I don’t need one right now.
                    The sight the out of breath Liecia saw when she threw open the massive doors was the sight of her parents on the attached balcony enjoying a refined afternoon teatime and holding a cream scone going “Here, say aaah—” “Aaaaaah—”. Liecia sat down hard for a moment, but immediately stood up and drew close to the previous king with an angry look in her eyes.
                    “I, ran all the way here from my regional patrols when I heard Father’s throne was usurped! So why are you going [Here, say Aaah—♪] so carefreely!”
                    As it happens, in addition to the title of Princess (fiancée to the current king after the abdication), she also graduated from a military academy and possesses an Officer title. Her social position itself isn’t that high, but due to her high birth she often gets orders to go around to each regional army for sympathy calls and the like. She was on one of those missions just now but upon hearing of her Father’s sudden abdication she came in a big hurry.
                    “We weren’t really usurped, we abdicated out of our own will”
                    “We talked with that man and believed he is necessary for this country. This is something we judged as one with the responsibility of looking after the country. We take no objections.”
                    The instant he made that declaration he seemed to show a little bit of the dignity of someone who carries a kingdom on his shoulders, so Liecia was reluctant to press the issue any further.
                    “Uuuh…. but, to even arbitrarily decide my marriage”
                    “Motheeer”
                    Liecia looked to her mother for help, but the former Queen smiled and said.
                    “Go see Soma-dono first. This concerns your life after all, you should decide your future course by yourself. We will respect what you decide.”
                    So this is what they call not having an island to cling to. Liecia slumped her shoulders.
                    Liecia was walking through the castle at a quick pace.
                    She left this castle a few weeks ago to do her regional patrols. She was wondering how the castle was doing after she hadn’t seen it for weeks, but everyone in the castle were running. The soldiers, the chamberlains, the bureaucrats, and even the ministers were all running. The sight of the round-bellied cabinet minister sweating from his forehead going “huff huff” as he ran was so surreal she stood there dumbfounded.
                    This has never happened before. The castle’s atmosphere was supposed to be so relaxed you’d think that time flows more slowly here. The chamberlains and cabinet ministers would walk softly, and it should have been so quiet you can hear the voices of the soldiers practicing at the courtyard from anywhere in the castle. Didn’t Liecia enter the military academy even though she was a princess because she was sick of that kind of atmosphere?
                    But look at it now. No matter where you go in the castle you can hear somebody’s footsteps.
                    Liecia called one of the maids who was running in a flurry.
                    “Can I talk to you for a moment?”
                    “Ah, no… The castle’s looking busy, did anything happen?”
                    “Really? It feels somewhat busy to me though…”
                    “T, that so? Do your best”
                    Looking at the maid leaving in a quick pace, Liecia became dumbfounded. Just how is that new king working to even make a maid go that far! Just what kind of person became my fiancé. Liecia was at her wits’ end.
                    The Royal Governmental Affairs Room. As Liecia opened the door the first thing she saw was a mountain of paper. The documents were piled up high in a heap, all but overflowing from a large desk that can seem to fit two grown men laying down. That was not all. Looking around there were several bureaucrats on other long tables fighting hard before similar bundles of paper.
                    As Liecia became dumbfounded, there was a young man’s voice from behind the mountain of paper.
                    “Oi, the one who just came in”
                    “…………………. Ae!? What!?”
                    She let out a strange sound as she came to her senses, but the owner of the voice didn’t seem to notice.
                    “You, can you read? Can you do arithmetic?”
                    “Good then. Come here and help me work”
                    “Don’t worry about that, help me. This is a ‘Royal Order’.”
                    As he said that, the person behind the mountain of paper stood up and finally showed his face.
                    Liecia would later on recount her first impression of him being “a young man with tired eyes.”
                    In stories where a hero was summoned to another world there were lots of cases where the hero was given special powers upon being summoned. In most cases, it would be the power to face off alone against a thousand or a power that looked useless at first glance but is actually an incredible power that could conquer the world, the so-called “ME STRONK”²-kind of power.
                    ² «TN: 俺TUEEEE»
                    I thought, so I suppose I should have gotten some power, and of course, I seem to have been given some powers. The first is [Multiple Concurrent Parallel Thought]. I can now think several thoughts simultaneously. While having a meeting about matter A, I can think about matter B in my head. I feel like I can probably win a Shoutoku Taishi³ game against 10 people right now.
                    ³ «TN: Prince Shoutoku (Shoutoku Taishi) can »
                    The other one is [Weak Telekinesis]. I can move things up to 300 grams in weight without touching, disregarding gravity. The lighter the object is, the more freely I can control it, also, together with Parallel Thought, I can move several things at a time. As a plus, it’s quite amazing that I can see from an overlooking vantage point outside my normal point of view.
                    Then to talk about what I can do to completely exhibit these two powers, it’s doing paperwork at three times the normal speed.
                    While looking over three documents simultaneously with parallel thought, I work two pens with weak telekinesis, and together with the one in my right hand I work three pens to sign each document. Yes, I’m making progress. In fact, if it weren’t for these powers I’d be buried in a landslide of documents right about now.
                    
                    …… Yeah, I know what you want to say. That’s not a ME STRONK power at all. To put it in the words of a certain doujin’s shooting style [it’s a power only fit for paperwork]. Yeah, shabby. Even though it’s useful right now, but when you think that the reason I was summoned was to fight the Demon King all you can say is “how did this happen!?” Even if it wasn’t a magic strong enough to fight ten thousand enemies, at the very least I’d rather get something like a sword skill I can use to defend myself with.
                    To return to the main subject, as I was using those powers to combat the mountain of paper, the sturdy door was kicked in by a girl in military dress. She had a well featured face, transparent-white skin, flowing platinum blonde hair. She’s a beautiful girl that were I to see her during peacetime I would undoubtedly became fascinated, but to me who had already stayed up three nights I can no longer see her as a beautiful girl but only as some “fresh labor”. I half-forcibly sat her next to me and pushed two bundles of paper on her.
                    “Compare these two documents and when you see numbers that don’t match or different number of entries, put a checkmark on it.”
                    “What you say…? We’re digging buried treasure”
                    I carelessly said, seeing the girl in uniform confused.
                    “Buried treasure?”
                    “A, all right”
                    Perhaps feeling threatened by the attitude of a person who had just done an all-nighter, she did as I told her. Just like that, after about two hours passing with her working silently next to me, the girl in military dress suddenly talked to me without stopping her hands check marking the documents.
                    “Hey”
                    “Not that…… I haven’t told you my name yet. I’m Liecia Elfrieden, daughter of the previous king Alberto Elfrieden”
                    The moment the girl said that, the three pens I was manipulating stopped.
                    I stared wide-eyed at the girl who called herself Liecia.
                    “…… So you’re the princess”
                    “Well, you’re wearing military uniform. But…. yeah, you kinda look like one”
                    Now that you mention it, she has class, making me aware of her high-spec looks.
                    “I’m … Souma Kazuya. I’m acting as the current king for now”
                    Liecia turned her face towards me. We’re looking really close into each others’ eyes. Unlike me who was just taken aback, her golden pupils seems like she’s evaluating me. After staring for a while Liecia finally opened her mouth.
                    “I’m not a princess anymore. Since you usurped the throne my position is a bit delicate”
                    “……. Just what happened? I know you’re the summoned hero, but why did it suddenly turn into handing over the throne”
                    “I’d like to know that, too. All I wanted was to keep myself safe…”
                    When I was summoned into this world I was on the brink of being sent to the Empire. The King didn’t seem too eager to do so but he had no other special plans, if the Empire made another forced appeal he can do nothing but send me over. Then if I was sent to the Empire in the end, no matter which way my fate turns there’s no bright future in sight. In order to protect myself, I needed to make them choose to not send the hero over.
                    The plan I presented to the king was to buy time by “paying the support money”, and using that time to press a “rich country, strong army policy”. Since they said “if you can’t pay then just send the hero over”, we can pay and get it over with. They would then lose any pretense with which to interfere. It was an attempt at intimidation but since it wasn’t a real intimidation, I judged that the Empire would care about their honor and not press any further than that. With the time we gained by that, we would advance the ‘rich country strong army policy’ and build a country that won’t yield even if the Empire threatens us again.
                    Of course, those two had objections. “This country doesn’t have the funds to pay the support money with,” they said. However, with the materials I examined, I showed them that payment is possible by selling off some government facilities, suppressing government spending, and handing over ‘the king’s private property’ to some extent. I attended an undergraduate program in socio-economics and dreamed of becoming a government employee. This much is within my field of expertise.
                    The King looked worried seeing the plan, but Prime Minister Markus seemed eager. He seemed to have judged that rather than sending the hero away to maintain the status quo, it was better for the country’s future to reform the economy. I was relieved at Prime Minister’s eagerness. As the person who suggested it I was probably expected to do some work, probably as a finance officer, helping with the reform… or so I thought.
                    “But then they made me King”
                    “You have nothing to apologize for. Actually, you’re a victim here, being suddenly told you have a fiancé”
                    “Yeah, that’s true… wait, huh? I wonder which of us has the higher position. Was it bad that I haven’t been using polite language?”
                    On the one hand we have a former commoner, current King. On the other we have a former princess, current Queen candidate.
                    “……. I guess you can just talk casually”
                    “Also, don’t worry about the engagement. I’m only looking after the throne right now. I’ll probably quit being King in a few years”
                    “I didn’t intend to do more work than earning [support money] so I don’t get sent to the Empire to begin with. Now that the throne has been handed to me, I’ll at least put the country’s economy on track, but I’ll let the people choose what comes next. Of course, I’m okay with cancelling the engagement”
                    Liecia stared wide-eyed at Soma who uttered such words.
                    (No no, he easily said so but does he understand how hard it is to do)
                    Even the military-obsessed Liecia who is unfamiliar with government affairs understands this country’s situation. It was on the brink of a [checkmate]. It was low in food sufficiency to begin with, the recession, the influx of refugees from the Demon King invasion, then the pressure from the Grand Chaos Empire…. all are causes for concern to deal with. In all likelihood, even if the previous King’s reign continued it’ll only last several more years. As might be expected from a military academy graduate, Liecia can see these things with a calm eye.
                    Therefore she somewhat understands the actions of her father who surrenders the throne to someone he sees as superior right on the spot. But then, could he even do this putting this country’s economy on track thing? If let’s say he could, then are the people going to let the King that accomplished such feats retire just like that.
                    “…. So, you think you can secure the support money?”
                    “………………………… Eh?”
                    “I’m now raising funds for the reform. Frankly, it takes more money than paying the Empire”
                    No…. wait hold on right there! Already secured he says? the money the Empire asked was supposedly as big as a third of the country’s annual budget. It rivaled a smaller country’s total annual budget and he says he’s already got it ready?
                    “Where did you find that kind of…”
                    “Treasure chamber…? The National Treasures!?”
                    He actually sold the National Treasures!? What is he thinking!
                    I questioned Soma who nonchalantly did something so outrageous as that.
                    “The National Treasures belong to the whole country you know! Selling that out on your own accord is treason to the people!”
                    “Yes, but…. There are things there with cultural and historic significance”
                    “Ah— I’ve excluded those things. The things I’ve sold are the hard assets like gems and ornaments”
                    Soma tracked down and presented a catalogue put together regarding the National Treasures from the stack of documents.
                    “I divided the National Treasures into [Group A: things with cultural value], [Group B: things without cultural value but has property value], and [Group C: others], and sold only Group B. Rather than selling group A it would be better to put them on display in galleries or museums at regular intervals for long term acquisition of foreign currency”
                    “Magic items, magic books and stuff. I actually don’t know how to treat them. They’re something like weapons, so to speak. I can’t just sell them away or put them on display. Though the [set of hero’s equipment] looked like it’s going to sell for quite a lot”
                    “Please stop that…”
                    You’re still a hero, even for a moment… Ah, but you’re a King now.
                    “But, if we had that kind of money shouldn’t we have put it to arming ourselves to prepare against the Empire? I was taught to [better gamble 1000 yen in national defense than give one tenth of a rin⁴ in tribute] in the academy”
                    “What’s with your phrasing?”
                    “No way… The people should recognize what a threat the Empire is”
                    ⁴ «TN: 1 rin = 1/1000 yen»
                    The look in Soma’s eyes was awfully cold as he said that.
                    It’s just that… I don’t know.
                    “Well now, should we get back to work?”
                    “….”
                    I felt as if my chest tightened from his gaze.
                    We continued for another day and was finally able to secure a certain amount of money. Though it won’t bring us to prosperity it can act as funds for pressing reforms. Being able to raise this much funds from just the directly controlled territories without touching the ‘Three Duchies’, I think it’s worth praising.
                    Looking around inside the room there were dead bodies strewn about. Among the bureaucrats there are those who were sleeping face down on the desks, and there are also those who sleep laying back on their chairs, looking up at the ceiling. As for myself, I have already stayed up four nights, but by splitting my consciousness into three using parallel thought I can let them take turns sleeping one at a time so I don’t feel tired mentally (though since it’s physically exhausting I don’t want to use it frequently)
                    Meanwhile, on the Government Affairs Room sofa, Liecia was lying down sleeping. I quietly drew near and sat on the sofa’s armrest, gazing at the sleeping Liecia. In the end she helped me work until almost dawn. She must have lots of things to say after suddenly getting a fiancé, but I have to thank her for cooperating with my work despite all that.
                    I brushed the sleeping Liecia’s head. Her silky hair glided between my fingers.
                    The feeling of elation from being released from a long stretch of work probably had something to do with this. It’s quite an embarrassing act to do sober.
                    “Mu—…”
                    Liecia groaned and I let my hand off her hair. The next moment, Liecia opened her eyes and suddenly sat upright. She was still sleepy, looking blankly all over the place. I smiled as I called her out.
                    “Morning Liecia”
                    “The work’s over. You want to sleep a little more?”
                    “Ah, no. I’m good. Rather, how about you Soma? You havent slept at all right?”
                    It seems like she’s already fully awake, and I’m honestly happy that she worries about me.
                    I got up from the armrest and made an exaggerated stretch.
                    “I’m planning to rest easy after this, but… oh, right. Will you come with me for a moment?”
                    “A walk before bed”

                        RISE OF THE SHIELD HERO CHAPTER 1
                        "Hmm..."
                        I had come to the town library to hang out and read some books.
                        Wait, that's a terrible place to start. I haven't even introduced myself yet. The name's Iwatani Naofumi, college sophomore, and I'm what most people would call an otaku. I wasn't always this way, but after I was introduced to video games, anime, and otaku culture, there was no way I could ever go back to caring about something as boring as studying.
                        Once my parents realized I was a lost cause, they decided to focus their efforts on my little brother instead, forcing him into some big-name cram school to "ensure his future". Unfortunately, I think he must have cracked from the pressure of living up to their expectations and preparing for entrance exams, since he ended up dying his hair blond and talking like a punk. It was a really dark time for our family.
                        But then, a savior appeared: me!
                        I approached my dear, foul-tempered little brother and told him to play a certain mega-popular dating sim.
                        "You fuckin' with me or somethin'!? Get the fuck out of here!"
                        "Geez, just trust me and play it, okay?"
                        I knew the real reason my little brother went bad. It's because unlike me, who got everything I ever wanted growing up, he was forced to do nothing but study day in and day out. He desperately needed an outlet for his frustration. And when a relaxation specialist like me makes a recommendation, well, even my brother couldn't help but have his interest piqued.
                        ...To make a long story short, the world gained another otaku. Since then, my brother's room has been totally transformed, filled to the brim with merch from the dating sim I recommended. On top of that, with his stress gone he managed to pass all his exams and get into a super prestigious high school. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't just a little bit irritating.
                        On the plus side, thanks to my efforts my parents lightened up on me, and I was finally able to enjoy a carefree college life. I guess you could call me the black sheep of the Iwatani family.
                        Anyway, where was I? Oh, right, the library.
                        My parents had already given me my monthly allowance of 10,000 yen, which I converted directly into light novels, manga, and porn. I made another 50,000 yen a month from my part-time job, but between the summer and winter comiket, and all the various local festivals, that didn't go very far either. In fact, it was looking like I was probably going to have to crash at my parents' house again for a while...
                        Still, I was able to live the way I liked, so I couldn't really ask for more. As far as I was concerned, just having my tuition and food expenses covered was more than enough. That didn't change the fact that I was dead broke, though, so in the interests of frugality, I was passing the time reading random books in used bookstores and libraries.
                        I briefly considered getting back into the online game I'd been playing recently, but doing that would mean resigning myself to an infinite time sink. See, I'm the kind of guy that values breadth over depth. Rather than racing for the level cap like most people, I preferred to spend all my play time leisurely making money. In fact, I had a character selling rare items in the in-game marketplace at that very moment.
                        Unfortunately, that meant the real-life me had more free time than he knew what to do with - which is where the library came in.
                        It happened while I was scanning over the section dedicated to old fantasy novels. You might not realize this, but fantasy is as old as humanity itself. Even the bible is basically a fantasy novel, when you get right down to it.
                        "The Weapons of the Four Saints?"
                        For some reason, a worn out old book with a nearly-illegible title suddenly fell off the shelf. Maybe the last person that looked at it had been careless when they put it back? Or, maybe it was fate. At any rate, I sat down in a chair and started reading.
                        *flip**flip**flip*
                        Apparently it was one of those books that starts by going over the setting in excruciating detail. There was a lot to take in, but the gist of it was that a prophecy foretold the end of the world. According to the prophecy, the world would be destroyed by wave after wave of disasters. In order to avert this calamity, the people called out for Heroes from another world to save them.
                        "...It's a pretty cliched plot, but I guess I can't expect too much of from an antique. It must have seemed pretty fresh back in the day."
                        Four Heroes were summoned, wielding four weapons: sword, spear, bow, and shield.
                        "Haha, what? A shield isn't even a weapon, it's armor!"
                        I laughed wryly, but kept on reading. In the end, the Heroes set out on a journey to gain strength and polish their skills in order to fight the Wave of Calamity.
                        *yawn*
                        A wave of sleepiness washed over me. Seriously, would it have killed them to add a cute girl or two to keep the reader's interest? I mean, technically there was a princess, but she seemed like a total bitch. The way she toadied up to all of the Heroes was totally disgusting. Like, just pick a guy and stick with him, right?
                        Oh, well, at least there was a decent enough cast of characters. The dashing Sword Hero, and the thoughtful Spear Hero. The Robin Hood-esque Bow Hero, working to topple a corrupt kingdom. But when the story turned its attention toward the Shield Hero...
                        "Huh?"
                        I inadvertently let out a gasp as I flipped through the pages. Everything after the page about the Shield Hero was completely blank. No many how many times I looked, there was nothing there.
                        "What the hell is this?"
                        Before I knew what was happening, my vision grew dim and my consciousness began to fade. Even in my wildest dreams, I never could have imagined that - just like that - I'd end up in another world.

                <div class="col-4 text-center">
                    <p> The Rise of the Shield Hero is about a man named Iwatani Naofumi, who was forcefully transported to a different world. The gripping tale of a man lost in a different world full of magic and monsters, struggling to cope with a world that obeys the rules of a classic rpg system. Naofumi, unfamiliar with such video game thropes is forced to save it while dealing with all sort of obstacles 
                        and discrimination that is very different from home of modern day peaceful Japan. His journey to understanding this world subjects you to a wild ride of emotions and makes you wonder what your own decision would have been if placed in his shoes. His character development alone warrants a read, while the overall story will keep those pages turning.
